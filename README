1. Overview
===========

Libfoobar is dummy library whose sole purpose is to test the combination
of module aliases and -no-alias-deps (introduced in OCaml 4.02) within a
project using OASIS+OCamlbuild.

The actual inner dependencies of the project are as follows:

Foo.ml:		(none)
Foo_a.ml:	Foo
Foo_b.ml:	Foo, Foo_a
Foo_c.ml:	Foo, Foo_a, Foo_b

Bar.ml:		(none)
Bar_a.ml:	Bar, Foo, Foo_a
Bar_b.ml:	Bar, Bar_a, Foo, Foo_b
Bar_c.ml:	Bar, Bar_a, Bar_b, Foo, Foo_c

Note that the list above does not correspond to the dependencies computed
with version 4.02 of OCamldep.  The script myocamldep.ml postprocesses
OCamldep's output to bring it in line with the actual dependency graph
(the script is called my OCamlbuild as a frontend to OCamldep).


2. External dependencies
========================

Libfoobar depends on Batteries [1].


3. Building and installing
==========================

The build system relies on OASIS.  The customary sequence of './configure',
'make', and 'make install' is used to build and install the library.


4. License
